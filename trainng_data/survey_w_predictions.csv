"where possible or appropriate, live snippets of various members playing while the concert is being performed, perhaps on the large background screen at hamer hall for example. i belive it would bring a bit more colour , and enable players to be seen close up. often hard from many seats at a concert.",Programming and concert format,neutral,Non-subscriber
"would like better accessibility to programs prior to the concert and on arrival, either cheaper printed versions and also maybe a banner with qr code on arrival, as the context of some of the music i'm not as familiar with makes it much more enjoyable and engaging when i know more about the piece, the composer and the interpretation.  i'd also like more movie scores at a reasonable price, or added to the membership ticket discounts.",Programming and concert format,neutral,Non-subscriber
